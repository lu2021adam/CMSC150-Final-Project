# CMSC150-Final-Project
This project was created by Adam Bruce in the Winter of 2023 for CMSC 150 at Lawrence University.
The objective of the game is to battle with your selected Pokémon through the Elite Three.
If you beat the Grand Master of the Pokémon Elite Three, then you win the game!

Good luck trainers!
